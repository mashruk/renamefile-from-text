# About

This is a file rename utlity utlizing the `fs` module that renames files in a folder by taking in a `txt` file as an input.

This is done by creating a folder that has to have all your files prefixed with some matching common word as `lesson1, lesson2, lesson3 ....lesson n` or `photo1, photo2, photo3, .....photo n` and a `.txt` in which the filename will be the folder name you want to give and the content of the text should be what you want the filenames to be.
